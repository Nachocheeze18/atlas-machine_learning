# Using the requests package:
Install requests via pip (pip install requests). Import the package into your Python script (import requests).

# Making HTTP GET requests:
Utilize requests.get(url) to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.

# Handling rate limits:
Check the HTTP status code of the response. If you encounter a rate limit (often indicated by a status code like 429), consider waiting for a period before retrying the request.

# Handling pagination:
Many APIs implement pagination using query parameters in the URL. You typically loop through pages until there are no more pages to fetch.

# Fetching JSON resources:
After making a request, retrieve the JSON data from the response using response.json().

# Manipulating data from an external service:
Once you have obtained the JSON data, manipulate it as needed. This could involve iterating through items, extracting specific fields, performing calculations, or transforming the data in various ways.

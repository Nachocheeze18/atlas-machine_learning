# Relational Database:

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns.
Data in relational databases are typically structured and related to each other through primary and foreign keys.

# Non-relational Database (NoSQL):

A non-relational database, often referred to as NoSQL (Not Only SQL), is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in ways other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
NoSQL databases are generally more flexible and scalable, and they can handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data.

# Difference between SQL and NoSQL:

SQL databases follow a predefined schema, use structured query language (SQL) for querying and manipulating data, and are generally vertically scalable.
NoSQL databases are schema-less or have flexible schemas, use various query languages or APIs, and are typically horizontally scalable.

# Creating Tables with Constraints:

In SQL, you can create tables with constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints using the CREATE TABLE statement.

# Optimizing Queries by Adding Indexes:

Indexes in databases help improve query performance by allowing the database engine to quickly locate rows based on the indexed columns. You can create indexes using the CREATE INDEX statement in SQL.

# Stored Procedures and Functions in MySQL:

Stored procedures and functions are precompiled SQL code that you can save and reuse in MySQL. They allow you to encapsulate complex logic and perform operations on the database server itself.

# Views in MySQL:

Views are virtual tables derived from one or more tables or other views. They allow you to simplify complex queries and provide an additional layer of security by restricting access to certain columns or rows.

# Triggers in MySQL:

Triggers are database objects that automatically execute in response to certain events (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a table. They are useful for enforcing data integrity rules or auditing changes.

# ACID:

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are properties that ensure database transactions are processed reliably.

# Document Storage:

Document storage is a type of NoSQL database that stores, retrieves, and manages document-oriented information. Documents can be in formats like JSON, BSON, XML, etc.

# NoSQL Types:

NoSQL databases can be categorized into key-value stores, document stores, column-family stores, and graph databases, among others.

# Benefits of NoSQL Databases:

NoSQL databases offer benefits such as scalability, flexibility, high performance, and better handling of unstructured data compared to traditional SQL databases.

# Querying Information from a NoSQL Database:

Querying in a NoSQL database depends on the specific database type and its query language or API. Common methods include using document-based query languages or APIs provided by the database.

# Inserting/Updating/Deleting Information from a NoSQL Database:

Similar to querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a NoSQL database depends on the specific database type and its provided APIs or commands.

# Using MongoDB:

MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database. You can interact with MongoDB using its query language (MongoDB Query Language), drivers for various programming languages, and a command-line interface (mongo shell). You can perform CRUD operations, create indexes, manage users, etc., in MongoDB.

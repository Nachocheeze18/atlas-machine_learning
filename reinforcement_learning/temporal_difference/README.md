Monte Carlo, Temporal Difference (TD), bootstrapping, n-step temporal difference, TD(λ), eligibility trace,
SARSA, SARSA(λ), SARSAMAX, on-policy, and off-policy are concepts related to reinforcement learning in artificial intelligence.

# Monte Carlo:

A method in reinforcement learning where an agent learns from the outcomes of complete episodes. It estimates the value of states by averaging the returns observed after visiting those states.
# Temporal Difference (TD):

A learning method where the agent updates its value estimates based on the difference between the predicted and actual rewards received at each time step.
Bootstrapping:

In reinforcement learning, bootstrapping refers to updating the value estimate of a state based on the estimated values of subsequent states. It involves using the current estimate to improve the estimate.
n-step Temporal Difference:

An extension of TD where the update is based on the sum of rewards for n consecutive time steps. It combines the benefits of both Monte Carlo and TD methods.
# TD(λ):

TD lambda is a method that combines ideas from TD and Monte Carlo by using a parameter λ to control the degree of bootstrapping. It involves a weighted combination of n-step returns for different values of n.
Eligibility Trace:

A mechanism used in TD(λ) to keep track of the eligibility of each state for receiving updates. It helps in attributing credit to states that contribute to the prediction of future outcomes.
# SARSA:

A type of reinforcement learning algorithm that updates the Q-values based on the current state (S), action taken (A), reward received (R), next state (S'), and next action (A').
# SARSA(λ):

An extension of SARSA that incorporates eligibility traces to update Q-values, allowing for a balance between on-policy and off-policy learning.
# SARSAMAX:

Also known as Q-learning, it is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that updates Q-values based on the maximum Q-value of the next state, regardless of the action taken.
# On-policy vs Off-policy:

On-policy methods learn the value function or policy that the agent is currently following, while off-policy methods learn a different policy, which can be different from the one the agent is following.

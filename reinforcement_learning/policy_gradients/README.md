## Reinforcement Learning: Policy Gradient Methods
# Policy Definition
In the realm of reinforcement learning, a policy refers to a strategy or set of rules that an agent follows within an environment. It outlines the agent's actions based on different states, aiming to maximize the cumulative reward.

# Policy Gradient
Policy gradient methods are a category of reinforcement learning algorithms designed for optimizing policies, particularly in continuous action spaces. The core concept involves parameterizing the policy and updating its parameters to enhance the expected cumulative reward.


# Monte-Carlo Policy Gradient
Monte-Carlo policy gradient methods estimate the gradient using sampled trajectories. The process involves running multiple episodes, collecting experiences, and utilizing them to estimate the gradient. The update rule often multiplies the gradient by the observed return to enhance the likelihood of actions leading to higher returns.

# Usage
To implement Monte-Carlo policy gradient methods:

Parameterize the policy.
Run episodes, collecting experiences.
Estimate the gradient using sampled trajectories.
Update policy parameters to improve performance.
By following these steps, agents can learn effective policies in complex reinforcement learning tasks.
